            <li>1/2 cup of Honey of the Gods</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of Sugar from the Land of the Giants</li>
            <li>1 tbsp of Lemon Juice from the World Tree</li>
            <li>1 tsp of Cinnamon from the Halls of Valhalla</li>
            <li>1 pre-made pie crust (or make your own if you're feeling heroic)</li>
            <li>A pinch of Dragon's Breath</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the filling:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>In a large bowl, combine the Mystical Blueberries, Golden Apples of Idunn, Honey of the Gods, Sugar from the Land of the Giants, Lemon Juice from the World Tree and Cinnamon from the Halls of Valhalla.<br>
                    Mix well until all the fruits are coated.</li>
                <li>Add a pinch of Dragon's Breath if you dare, for a little extra heat.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <li>Assemble the Pie:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Roll out the pie crust and place it in a pie dish. Pour the fruit mixture into the crust, spreading it evenly.</li>
                <li>If you want a top crust, roll out another pie crust and place it over the filling. Crimp the edges to seal, and cut a few slits in the top to let steam escape. Alternatively, you can create a lattice crust for a fancier look.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <li>Bake the Pie:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 190Â°C.</li>
                <li>Bake the pie for 45-50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <li>Serve:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Let the pie cool for a few minutes before slicing. Serve with a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream for an extra treat.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <br>
